# Record Tutorial with Vorec

## What is Vorec?

Vorec (vorec.ai) turns screen recordings into narrated tutorial videos. You record a flow — Vorec adds AI voice-over, zoom effects, cursor animations, subtitles, and a full video editor.

## How recording works

Recording is done by the **Vorec Recorder desktop app** (macOS only). The app captures the browser window natively (ScreenCaptureKit, 2× retina, H.264), uploads to Vorec, and returns an editor URL. The CLI (`@vorec/cli`) is a driver: it automates the browser and tells the app what to capture.

**You do not record with Playwright, FFmpeg, or any other tool. Only the app records. If the app is not installed, stop and tell the user to install it — do not suggest alternatives.**

## Your role as the AI agent

1. Verify the app is ready (installed, signed in, permission granted).
2. Write a `vorec.json` manifest describing the flow (url, viewport, actions).
3. Run `npx @vorec/cli run vorec.json`. The CLI launches Chromium, tells the app to record that window, drives the actions, stops, uploads, and starts analysis.
4. Return the editor URL to the user.

Vorec then:
- Reads your tracked actions (descriptions, context, coordinates)
- Writes narration scripts that explain each step
- Places click markers, zoom targets, and cursor effects using your coordinates
- Gives the user an editor URL where they can preview, edit, and export

**The better your action tracking (name, description, context), the better Vorec's narration will be.** You are the eyes — Vorec is the voice.

**Recording benchmarks:**
- Short tutorial: 5–15 tracked actions
- Deep walkthrough: 15–30 tracked actions
- Final video sweet spot: 1–3 minutes
- More than 30 actions or 4 minutes → consider splitting into multiple recordings

## 🎯 FIRST: Load agent-behavior rules

Before anything else, load [./rules/agent-behavior.md](./rules/agent-behavior.md). It's short and teaches you:
- Act first, ask later
- Never batch 3+ questions
- Prefer sensible defaults
- Fix silently, retry without reporting small failures
- End with a link/path, not an essay

**These rules override everything else.**

## Step 0: Detect the mode

**Auto-detect — don't ask the user unless you're unsure:**

- Project has `shopify.app.toml` OR URL is `admin.shopify.com/...` → **Shopify Admin mode** (load [./rules/shopify-admin.md](./rules/shopify-admin.md))
- User mentions an external URL (any third-party site — SaaS dashboards, landing pages, competitor products) → **Explore mode**
- User mentions their own project and you can see the codebase → **Connected mode**
- Not sure → ask ONE question.

**Shopify Admin:** embedded apps require special handling — never record from the raw tunnel URL, never automate Google login, use a dedicated browser profile.
**Connected:** you have the source code — read components for selectors, validation, success states.
**Explore:** you don't have the code — discover the page via Playwright snapshots. Load [./rules/explore.md](./rules/explore.md).

## Step 0.5: Detect the recording type

Load [./rules/recording-types.md](./rules/recording-types.md), then classify: task tutorial / website tour / bug reproduction / UX review.

For external URLs in Explore mode, also load [./rules/live-site-discovery.md](./rules/live-site-discovery.md).

## Prerequisites — ALL must pass

Run this single command and read the output:

```bash
npx @vorec/cli check
```

It verifies:
- **Vorec Recorder app** is running (macOS only)
- **User is signed in** to the app
- **Screen Recording permission** is granted
- **cliclick** is installed (so the cursor is visible in recordings)
- **Vorec account** has credits and project slots available

### If the app is NOT installed or not running

Stop and tell the user, verbatim:

> The Vorec Recorder app is required to record. Install it from https://vorec.ai/download, open it, sign in, and grant Screen Recording permission — then ask me again.

**Do not offer alternatives. Do not fall back to Playwright recordVideo, FFmpeg, screencapture, or any other tool. The app is the only supported recorder.**

### If cliclick is missing

Run `brew install cliclick`. Without it, the mouse cursor is not visible in the recording.

### API key

The CLI needs a Vorec API key for analysis steps. Save once: `npx @vorec/cli init` (the skill's rule files cover this — see [./rules/auth.md](./rules/auth.md)).

## Step 1: Write the manifest

Create `vorec.json` in the repo. This is the script the CLI runs.

```json
{
  "title": "<short tutorial title — what the user wants to learn>",
  "url": "<the URL to start on>",
  "viewport": { "width": 1600, "height": 1000 },
  "language": "en",
  "narrationStyle": "tutorial",
  "storageState": ".vorec/storageState.json",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "narrate", "delay": 4000, "description": "<orienting scene label>", "context": "<what the user is looking at right now>" },
    { "type": "click", "selector": "<selector>", "description": "<what this click does>", "context": "<what changes on screen>" },
    { "type": "type", "selector": "<input selector>", "text": "<value>", "description": "<what is being entered>" },
    { "type": "click", "selector": "<submit selector>", "description": "<end-state trigger>", "context": "<what the user now sees>" }
  ]
}
```

**Optional top-level fields that matter for specific surfaces:**

- `"chromeless": true` — **use this by default for single-URL tutorials on regular websites** (acme.com, google.com, any SaaS dashboard, any landing page). Launches Chromium in `--app=<url>` mode: no tab bar, no address bar, no bookmarks bar — the entire window is the webpage. Clean, tutorial-ready video with no browser UI bleed-through.
- `"recordFrame": "<iframe css selector>"` — auto-crops the MP4 to just that iframe's pixels. For **embedded apps** where the target UI lives inside a cross-origin `<iframe>` and the host chrome shouldn't end up in the tutorial: Shopify Admin (`iframe[src*='myshopify']`), Stripe Checkout, Salesforce Lightning, Intercom, YouTube embeds. Do **not** set `chromeless` together with `recordFrame` — the iframe crop already removes host chrome.
- `"viewport": "full"` — maximize the browser window instead of a fixed size.

### Decision tree for "do I want browser chrome in my recording?"

| Situation | Field to set |
|---|---|
| Recording a regular website (google.com, stripe.com, your SaaS dashboard) | `"chromeless": true` |
| Recording an embedded app inside another host (Shopify Admin, Salesforce, etc.) | `"recordFrame": "<iframe selector>"` |
| Recording a tutorial about the browser itself (extensions, DevTools, etc.) | neither — leave the full window visible |

**Default recommendation:** always set `"chromeless": true` unless you have a reason not to. Nobody wants Chrome's tab bar and address bar in their tutorial video.

**Action types:** `click` · `type` · `select` · `hover` · `scroll` · `wait` · `navigate` · `narrate`.

**Every action carries these four text-ish fields — always write all four:**

| Field | Purpose | Length |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | Timeline label shown in the editor | 5–10 words |
| `context` | Rich scene description (what's on screen, why it matters) — used by Vorec to ground narration generation | 1–3 sentences |
| `narration` | Draft of the spoken script for this moment — always included in the JSON Vorec receives; becomes final verbatim if `skipNarration: true`, otherwise Vorec polishes it | 1 spoken line |
| `pause` | Hold time in ms the narration has to be spoken in. Formula: `wordCount × 350 + 500` | integer |

- `narrate` = no interaction, just a pause with a scene description.
- `primary: true` on exactly ONE action per page = "this is the key click, zoom on it, gold-star it in the timeline".

### How narration actually works

Vorec **always** receives the full JSON — including your `narration` and `pause`. The `--skip-narration` flag on `vorec run` only controls whether Vorec polishes your draft or uses it verbatim:

| `--skip-narration` | Result |
|---|---|
| omitted (default) | Vorec regenerates narration using your draft + context as grounding. Polished for pacing/tone, semantically faithful to what you wrote. |
| passed | Your `narration` becomes the final spoken script verbatim. Use for legal copy, brand voice, translations. |

**So write narration drafts for every action.** They're never wasted — they ground Vorec even when being rewritten.

Writing good `context`: [./rules/context-writing.md](./rules/context-writing.md).

## Step 2: Record + analyze

```bash
npx @vorec/cli run vorec.json
```

One command, end-to-end. What happens:
1. CLI confirms the app is ready (otherwise aborts with a clear error).
2. Chromium launches at a fixed position so page coords map to screen coords.
3. CLI tells the app to record the Chromium window (native 2× retina H.264).
4. For each action: the Playwright action fires; coordinates are tracked live.
5. On stop: the app uploads the video to Vorec and returns the project ID.
6. CLI triggers narration analysis and polls until the editor is ready.
7. Final editor URL prints — `https://vorec.ai/editor?project=<id>`.

**Recording quality is fixed: 2× retina, 30 fps, H.264. Do not ask the user about quality, dpr, codec, or cursor styling — those aren't configurable.**

**Narration cost:** duration-based. Short (≤3min) = 8 credits, 3–8min = 15, 8–15min = 25, 15–30min = 45.

### Verbatim narration mode

If you want your `narration` drafts used word-for-word (no Gemini rewrite):

```bash
npx @vorec/cli run vorec.json --skip-narration
```

Same cost. Same pipeline. Only difference: Vorec echoes each action's `narration` field as the final spoken script, one segment per action. Use for legal copy, brand voice, or when you've already written the exact lines you want spoken.

## Step 3: Report

Print only the final editor URL once the command returns. No essays.

If the recording is broken and the user wants to discard:
- Delete the project in the Vorec Recorder app → Library (swipe-delete or Discard)
- Or programmatically: `DELETE http://127.0.0.1:47123/recordings/<id>` with the bridge token
- Then fix the manifest and re-run.

If the user wants to tweak narration later, point them to `vorec update-narration` (below).

## Updating narration on an existing project

```bash
# Read current narration
npx @vorec/cli segments --project <id> --json > segments.json

# Edit segments.json — update the "script" field on any row
npx @vorec/cli update-narration segments.json --project <id>
```

Details: [./rules/agent-behavior.md](./rules/agent-behavior.md) covers when to do this automatically.

## Translating narration

```bash
# List what exists
npx @vorec/cli languages --project <id>

# Pull English segments as the source of truth
npx @vorec/cli segments --project <id> --json > en.json

# Write a translations file
cat > es.json <<'EOF'
[
  { "id": "<segment-id>", "script": "Spanish text…" }
]
EOF

# Push
npx @vorec/cli update-translations es.json --language es --project <id>
```

Translations cost 0 credits — you (the agent) write them directly. Don't mention Vorec's internal AI models.

## When things go wrong

Load [./rules/troubleshooting.md](./rules/troubleshooting.md). Common issues:
- `vorec check` fails → fix what it reports, don't proceed
- Chromium window not found → make sure the browser actually launched; the CLI diffs window lists
- Cursor not visible → `brew install cliclick`
- Upload fails → check the user's credit balance via `vorec check`

## What not to do

- Do not record with Playwright's `recordVideo`, FFmpeg, `screencapture`, QuickTime, or any other tool. Only the Vorec Recorder app records.
- Do not mention internal Vorec systems (no model names, provider names, credit math beyond what `vorec check` prints).
- Do not batch setup questions. Fix silently and retry.
- Do not ship a recording under 10 seconds — it's almost certainly broken. Retry with more actions.
- Do not explain quality, retina, codec, or cursor options to the user — those are not configurable.
